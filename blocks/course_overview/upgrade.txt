This file describes API changes in the course_overview block.

== 3.1 ==

* Method block_course_overview_renderer::course_overview() doesn't use its
  second argument (overviews) any more. A debugging message is written if
  set.

* Method block_course_overview_renderer::activity_display() now is public.

* Method block_course_overview_renderer::collapsible_region_start() does not
  initialize collapsible regions inside it's method. Now it's delegated to
  javascript code in collapsible.js AMD module.
